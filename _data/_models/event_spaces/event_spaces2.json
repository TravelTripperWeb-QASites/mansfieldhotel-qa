  "description": "The Club Room is located off the main lobby and was originally designed as the parlor of the hotel. It has been meticulously restored to an original Beaux Arts library. Recreating turn-of-the-century craftsmanship, the Club Room features honey colored hardwoods, and luxurious furnishings that can serve as a home-like setting for entertaining, sharing cocktails over a match of chess or cribbage, or even in better days engaging in a friendly wager over a game of cards.",
